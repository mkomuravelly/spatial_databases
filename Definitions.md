The Esri shapefile, or simply a shapefile, is a popular geospatial vector data format for geographic information system software. 
It is developed and regulated by Esri as a (mostly) open specification for data interoperability among Esri and other GIS
 software products.[1] Shapefiles spatially describe vector features: points, lines, and polygons, representing, for example,
 water wells, rivers, and lakes.
 Each item usually has attributes that describe it, such as name or temperature.
 
 
 OSM file   : 
 
 The OpenStreetMap data model is a powerful yet simple way to represent geographic information. 
 Understanding the data model enables you to interact with OpenStreetMap data in its raw form so that you can manipulate it
 into formats that are more useful for what you're trying to do. You'll want to understand the data model if you are interested in 
 writing a map editor, converting the raw OpenStreetMap data into a format for use in an application, 
 or if any of the existing software tools don't provide functionality that you want.
 
 Geojson   : 
 
 
 GeoJSON is a format for encoding a variety of geographic data structures. 
 A GeoJSON object may represent a geometry, a feature, or a collection of features.
 GeoJSON supports the following geometry types: Point, LineString, Polygon, MultiPoint, MultiLineString, MultiPolygon, 
 and GeometryCollection. Features in GeoJSON contain a geometry object and additional properties, and a feature collection 
 represents a list of features.
